Visualizing Convolutions
Joren Husic

The majority of the code is contained in visualize_convolution.py.
Running this file will produce six gif files containing animations
that serve as a visualization of the pairwise convolutions of four
different functions.

Computational verification of a number of properties of convolutions
(commutativity, associativity, distributivity, and the existence of
and identity) can be found in convolution_properties.py.
