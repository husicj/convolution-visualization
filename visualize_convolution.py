# GOALS:
#   generate visualizations of convolutions between:
#      rectangle
#      isoceles triangle
#      right triangle
#      causally decreasing exponential function
#
#   computationally confirm the following properties of convolution
#    with RMS error calculation:
#     commutativity
#     assiciativity
#     distributivity
#   and demonstrating through animation the multiplicative identity
